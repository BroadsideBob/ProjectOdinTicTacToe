Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, Javascript, CoPilot

Features Implemented: Win/Loss detection, 2-player playability, reset ability. 

Learning Opportunities: CoPilot is a lot more trustworthy than I originally thought, but its products still need human revision.

Additional Notes: I initially thought trying to use AI at all in this project would be a hassle - I was the only one in the class to say that I didn't trust AI-generated code at all. 
To this extent, I still think I am justified in this doubt, as the code CoPilot generated still didn't fully function without prompting it a few additional times. 
However, I am very willing to admit it was far easier and more efficient than I thought, and using this technology more often would be wise on my end.
